# Worker pool

## Motivation

Worker pool is a very popular and robust pattern. We felt some paintful when implementing the partern because of we don't have enought time to complete the task if we spent lot of time on the API design:
 - There are reapted code in my project.
 - Reusibility of the code is low because: tight coupling with low level API, worker implementation doesn't follow a consistency pattern...
