# Worker pool

## Motivation

Worker pool is a very popular and robust pattern. We felt some pain when implementing the pattern because we don't have enough time to complete the task if we spent a lot of time on the API design:
 - There is repeated code in my project.
 - The reusable code is low because tight coupling with low-level API, worker implementation doesn't follow a pattern that makes worker can be reusable somewhere else...
